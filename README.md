# 12C-Hydrogen2-25-26
Hello! This is our code for Robot 2: "Hydrogen 2" for the 25/26 Push Back Season.

All of our ".cpp" files have comments that explain the function(s) of almost every line. Each subsystem/mechanism has its own ".cpp" file, where we assign the buttons that will control certain actions and any other macros/automations relating to the subsystem/mechanism. These functions are then recalled in "main.cpp."

All autonomous routines, match or skills, can be found in "autons.cpp." Every autonomous routine has comments that explain what each chunk of code does.

All ".cpp" files can be found in "src" folder. The "include" folder contains all the ".hpp" files, where we assign the ports for motors and pistons, as well define the functions that we create in the ".cpp" files. The other folders in the "include" folder are not created by us and are part of EZ-Template.

Feel free to use this repository however you would like, with the exception of exactly copying the code. We hope this is helpful!
